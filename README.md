# JAGS module template

This JAGS module template contains examples of implementations of functions and distributions in JAGS.

This work is based on [Wabersich, D., & Vandekerckhove, J. (2014). Extending JAGS: A tutorial on adding custom distributions to JAGS (with a diffusion model example) *Behavior Research Methods, 46,* 15-28.](http://www.cidlab.com/prints/wabersich2014extending.pdf) and I would highly recommend reading this paper before you start making a JAGS module.

It's also good to use already existing modules as templates for your own module, such as:
- [Bernoulli](https://github.com/yeagle/jags-bernoulli)
- [Wiener](https://github.com/yeagle/jags-wiener)
- [rescorlaWagner](https://github.com/raviselker/jags-rescorlaWagner)
- [wfComboPack](https://github.com/raviselker/jags-wfComboPack)
